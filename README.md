# Gal4Xy
A turn-based 4X game where you play against the computer to conquer the galaxy

**This is a work in progress! The README will be updated when more functionality is added and when the game actually becomes playable.**

## What works
  * The galaxy and planets are initialized, and home planets are randomly chosen for the human and AI players.
  * By default, only two players are created, but the game can handle multiple players. 
  * The galaxy may be displayed for the human player.
  * The galaxy may be displayed in "cheat" mode (all planets are visible).
  * The main game loop. 

## TODO
  * Ensure that player symbols/colors are unique.
  * Take into account dark/light background for console text.
  * Take all AI players into account (incoming fleet) when displaying the galaxy in cheat mode.
