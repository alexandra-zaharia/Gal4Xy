# Gal4Xy
A turn-based 4X game where you play against the computer to conquer the galaxy

**This is a work in progress! The README will be updated when more functionality is added and when the game actually becomes playable.**

## What works

* The galaxy and planets are initialized, and home planets are randomly chosen for the human and AI players.
* The galaxy may be displayed for the human player.
* The main game loop.
